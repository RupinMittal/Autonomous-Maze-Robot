# Autonomous Maze Robot

## Made with IEEE UCLA

### Description

(Still in progress).
This project is an autononmous maze navigating robot. It was built from scratch with 
the help of IEEE at UCLA (and my leads Bradley Schulz and Tyler Price).

### Software

The microcontroller used was the STM 32 Microcontoller, so the programs were written in 
the C programming language. Since all the embedded code was written from the ground up, it 
includes (at this point in time):

- Motor Control (PID)

The files included in this repository are only the main.c and main.h profile since the rest of 
the code files are automatically configured by the STM 32 Cube IDE. 

All explanations for software are in the code documentation files.

### Hardware 

The custom PCB was built by Bradley Schulz and Tyler Price from IEEE UCLA, although I have made 
my own schematic designs for the whole project (included in this repository). All schematics were 
made with EAGLE.

All explanations for hardware design are in the hardware design documentation.
