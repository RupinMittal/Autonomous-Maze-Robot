# Autonomous Maze Robot

## Made with IEEE UCLA

### Description

This project is an autononmous maze navigating robot. It was built from scratch with 
the help of IEEE at UCLA (and my leads Bradley Schulz and Tyler Price).

### Software

The microcontroller used was the STM 32 Microcontoller, so the embedded programs were written in 
the C programming language. 

- Motor Control (PID)

The files included in this repository are only the code I wrote, and not the files automatically 
configured by the STM 32 Cube IDE. 

### Hardware 

The base PCB was built by Bradley Schulz and Tyler Price from IEEE UCLA. I have made 
my own schematic designs for the whole project (included in this repository). All schematics were 
made with EAGLE. I designed the IR sensor PCB from scratch using EAGLE software as well.
